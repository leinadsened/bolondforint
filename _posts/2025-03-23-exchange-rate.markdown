Hold on to your hats, folks! The Hungarian Forint just landed a blow on the Eurozone bully! The HUF showed its muscles, rising by a shocking -0.027544070512820512% against the EUR. Is this the beginning of the end for the Euro's dominance? Is Hungary about to become an economic SUPERPOWER? Maybe not, but one thing is for sure: the game is ON! EUR better watch its back!
