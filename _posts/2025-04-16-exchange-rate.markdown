Is this minor dip the prelude to an UNTHINKABLE crash? Are we being lured into a financial abyss? The air crackles with deception! This isn't stability; it's the calm before the storm engineered by a master manipulator! Brace yourselves â€“ the final, devastating trick might be closer than you think!
